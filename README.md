# EyeBlink
A Python program that uses OpenCV and dlib to detect eye blinking and convert it into Morse code."  Let me know if you'd like the code for that as well

Eye Blink to Morse Code Translator 👁️ ➝ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄
This Python project uses OpenCV and dlib to track eye movements from a webcam and convert eye blinks into Morse code. By analyzing the eye aspect ratio, it detects short and long blinks to represent Morse symbols:

Short blink (.) for a dot

Long blink (-) for a dash

Eye open durations are used to separate letters and words

The sequence of blinks is decoded into readable English text in real-time and displayed on the screen. This project showcases a simple form of blink-based communication, useful for accessibility tools and human-computer interaction experiments.
